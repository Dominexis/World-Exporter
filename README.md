# World Exporter
The World Exporter is used to export Bedrock worlds into the .mcworld format, as well as gather up any packs which are installed.

## How to use
Put the Python script into the com.mojang folder and run it. Enter in the display name of the world. When you are prompted to install add-ons, drag the add-on files into the Python terminal to get the full file path. Your .mcworld file will be created in the "World Exports" folder.

## Requirements
The World Exporter requires Python 3.9 or newer.
